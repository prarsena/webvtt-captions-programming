NOTE On Regions
- A WebVTT region represents a subpart of the video viewport and provides a limited rendering area for WebVTT caption or subtitle cues.
- Regions provide a means to group caption or subtitle cues so the cues can be rendered together, which is particularly important when scrolling up.

*Singing* And I <lang en-GB>learned <lang en-US>to get</lang> along and so</lang> you

 I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:20.640 line:90 align:right position:100% size:40%

 I should have made you leave your key

 on now, go! Walk out the door!
